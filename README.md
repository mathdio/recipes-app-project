# 👩‍🍳 A recipes app developed as a [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/) Project

## 💻 About this project
In this application, the user can see, search, filter, favorite and keep up with the progress of recipes' preparation.

This app's database uses 2 distincts APIs, one for meals and another one for drinks, and the layout focus on mobile devices, thus the app was developed for smaller screens (recommmended resolution: 360 x 800).
